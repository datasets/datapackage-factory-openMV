# Description
Thickness of a single wafer, measured at 9 locations for 184 consecutive batches. A single wafer is removed from a tray of wafers (always at the same position for each batch of wafers) after the `chemical vapour decomposition` process is complete.

# Dataset
The data is from an industrial data (origin unknown). The data has been approximately centered and scaled to disguise the original variables - for confidentiality. There are 9 thickness locations on a single wafer.

# Preparation
Python version: 3.6
