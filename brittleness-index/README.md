# Description
A plastic product is produced in three parallel reactors (TK104, TK105, or TK107). For each row in the dataset, we have the same batch of raw material that was split, and fed to the 3 reactors. These values are the brittleness index for the product produced in the reactor.

# Dataset
The data has been simulated and consists of 15 rows and 3 columns.

# Preparation
Python version: 3.6
