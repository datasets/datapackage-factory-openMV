# Description
The taste of 27 pea varieties as measured by judges. After blanching the peas, the peas were quick-frozen, packed into bags and stored for 3 months.

# Dataset
The 6 attributes of flavour, `sweetness`, `fruity flavour`, `off-flavour`, `mealiness` and `hardness` were scored by the judges on a scale between 1 and 9.
The `whiteness`, 3 colour readings and skin appearance of the peas are also available. In addition, there are 6 chemical descriptors available: the `tenderometer` value, `% dry matter`, `% dry matter after freezing`, `sucrose` percentage and 2 `glucose` measurements.
