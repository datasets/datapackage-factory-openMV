# Description
Texture measurements of a pastry-type food.

# Dataset
The dataset has been simulated to represent the characteristics of an indutrial problem. The texture of food is measured using the following variables:

- `Oil`: percentage oil in the pastry
- `Density`: the productâ€™s density (the higher the number, the more dense the product)
- `Crispy`: a crispiness measurement, on a scale from 7 to 15, with 15 being more crispy.
- `Fracture`: the angle, in degrees, through which the pasty can be slowly bent before it fractures.
- `Hardness`: a sharp point is used to measure the amount of force required before breakage occurs.
