# Description
Snapshot measurements on 27 variables from a distillation column and have been measured over 2.5 years.

# Dataset
The data has been compiled from an industrial source, where variable names have been coded. e.g. `Temp1` is a temperature, but does not disclose where it is measured on the column. The last column, `VapourPressure`, is a quality variable measured in the laboratory. The other snapshot measurements in the row correspond to the process conditions when the sample was taken. The dataset consists of:

- `N=253` 
- `K=27`
- Outliers: yes
