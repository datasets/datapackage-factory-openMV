# Description
Pulp quality is measured by the lignin content remaining in the pulp: the Kappa number. This data set is used to understand which variables in the process influence the Kappa number, and if it can be predicted accurately enough for an inferential sensor application.

# Dataset
Variables with a number at the end have been lagged by that number of hours to line up the data. The dataset consists of:

- `N=301`
- `K=22`
- Missing data: Yes

# Preparation
