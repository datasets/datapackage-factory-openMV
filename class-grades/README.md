# Description
Grades from a Chemical Engineering course at McMaster University.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of 6 columns:
- `Assignment` : Average of assignments during the course. 
- `Tutorial` : Average of tutorials during the course. 
- `TakeHome` : Average of all questions on the take home exam.
- `Midterm` : Average of all questions on the midterm exam.  
- `Final` : Average of all questions on the final exam.
- `Prefix` : the year in which the student first enrolls at the university and is a crude approximation of the student's age (maturity).


The dataset can be used to find if any of the column is a good predictor of the student's performance in the final exam.
